## Question 1: Keywords Associated with Positive and Negative Sentiments

### Complaint Keywords Analyzed
- Maintenance
- Water leaks
- Pest control
- Elevator issues
- High cost/rent
- Deposit problems
- Soundproofing/noise
- Security issues

### Key Findings

**Strongly Negative Complaints (80–93% negative across all campuses):**
- Water leaks, unreturned deposits, security issues, elevator problems, and pest control are universally problematic
- These issues rarely turn positive regardless of campus

**Mixed Sentiment on Maintenance:**
- When maintenance requests are resolved quickly, reviews become positive (52–60% positive)
- **UIUC performs best on maintenance sentiment recovery (60% positive mentions)**

**Campus Differences:**
- **UIUC** slightly outperforms on elevator and water leak handling (lower negativity %)
- **BYU** struggles most with deposit handling (91% negative)
- **PSU** has fewer security-related complaints

**Actionable Takeaway:** Maintenance responsiveness is a controllable lever that flips sentiment. Other issues (deposits, leaks, security) require structural/policy fixes.

## Question 2: Owner Response Time Correlation to Sentiment

### Response Time Distribution
- **Within 1 day**: 59% positive, 33% negative (best outcome)
- **Within 1 week**: 61% positive, 31% negative (~20% lift vs. no response)
- **Within 1 month**: 52% positive, 40% negative
- **After 1 month / No response**: ~48% positive, ~36% negative

### Key Finding
**Owner engagement matters significantly.** A quick reply improves sentiment by approximately **20 percentage points**, even if the issue isn't immediately resolved.

### Recommendations for UIUC Companies
- Set a **3-day response target** for all reviews (captures most sentiment benefit)
- Delayed responses (>1 month) perform identically to no response—residents perceive abandonment
- Invest in review monitoring systems and trained response teams

## Question 3: Review Length vs. Rating Distribution

### Review Length Statistics by Rating

| Rating | Median Length | Mean Length |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 star | 490 chars | 693 chars |
| 2 stars | 566 chars | 779 chars (longest) |
| 3 stars | 290 chars | 514 chars |
| 4 stars | 220 chars | 314 chars |
| 5 stars | 170 chars | 245 chars |

### Key Findings

**Pattern:** Review length decreases by ~70% from 1★ to 5★. Dissatisfied tenants write detailed explanations of what went wrong, when, and how management failed to respond.

**Length-Likes Correlation: r = 0.40 (moderate positive)**
- Longer reviews attract more engagement (likes), regardless of sentiment
- Detailed complaints gain visibility and sympathy from other users
- A 500-char negative review likely reaches more prospective tenants than a 150-char positive note

**Implication for Management:** Negative reviews are *louder* in multiple ways—they're longer, more detailed, and generate more social proof. **Prevention is far more valuable than response.**

## Question 4: What Aspects Are Most Important to Address?

### Priority Ranking for Champaign/Urbana Management Companies

#### 1. **Responsive Maintenance & Repair Service** (Highest Impact)
- **Frequency:** ~20% of all reviews mention maintenance issues
- **Severity:** When handled well, 60% of reviews remain positive (vs. 52% at BYU)
- **Why it matters:** This is THE controllable operational lever—poor response converts satisfied tenants to dissatisfied ones
- **What works:** Same-day acknowledgment, 3-7 day resolution for non-emergencies

#### 2. **Fair & Transparent Security Deposit Handling**
- **Frequency:** 4-5% of reviews mention deposit issues
- **Severity:** 88% negative sentiment when mentioned (nearly universal dissatisfaction)
- **Why it matters:** Deposit disputes destroy trust and generate lengthy negative reviews (which get more engagement)
- **What works:** Clear damage policies, itemized refund statements, 2-week turnaround

#### 3. **Water Leak Prevention & Emergency Response**
- **Frequency:** ~2% of reviews mention water leaks
- **Severity:** 86% negative sentiment (single highest severity issue)
- **Why it matters:** Affects health, comfort, and property damage—delayed response is universal complaint
- **What works:** 4-hour emergency response guarantee, preventive inspections, water sensors

#### 4. **Elevator Maintenance for Multi-Story Buildings**
- **Frequency:** ~2% of reviews mention elevators
- **Severity:** 81% negative (only emerges when broken, causes major inconvenience)
- **Why it matters:** Strands elderly residents, affects delivery services, major accessibility concern
- **What works:** Monthly preventive maintenance contracts, 24-hour emergency repair guarantees

#### 5. **Security Infrastructure & Package Management**
- **Frequency:** ~10% of reviews mention security/trespassing/package theft
- **Severity:** 80% negative (creates ongoing anxiety about safety)
- **Why it matters:** Residents feel vulnerable; harder to fix without physical upgrades
- **What works:** 24/7 access logs, secure package lockers, adequate exterior lighting, visible security presence

#### 6. **Noise Control & Soundproofing**
- **Frequency:** ~3% of reviews mention noise/soundproofing issues
- **Severity:** 72% negative (lifestyle complaint, not emergency)
- **Why it matters:** Affects daily quality of life; structural fixes expensive and disruptive
- **What works:** Enforce quiet hours rigorously, upgrade insulation during renovations, address high-traffic areas

#### 7. **Competitive Pricing with Justifiable Value**
- **Frequency:** ~11% of reviews mention rent costs (UIUC lowest at 11.2%, BYU highest at 19.8%)
- **Severity:** 65% negative, 35% positive (shows tenants accept premium pricing if other aspects excellent)
- **Why it matters:** Price perception depends on perceived value delivered elsewhere
- **What works:** Competitive pricing + excellent service elsewhere = justification for premium

**Summary:** Maintenance responsiveness is the #1 controllable factor. Deposit handling and water leak response are structural issues that require process/policy attention. Security and noise are facility-dependent and harder to fix retroactively.
